# PartyGraphics
just some fun experimental stuff that you can play with!

This is one of my side-projects in which I am attempting to improve my coding abilities as fast as possible!

The central aims of this project are:

  -Usage of classes --> Utilizing inheritance is the forefront of this for me.
  
  -Experimenting/Understanding how controls work and their efficiency + viability in future projects.
  
  -Having some fun and something to do in my free time!
  
  
This project is open source and I dont mind people using it or my code -- but a name refrence and a link to my github would be nice!

Thanks for reading!

Sebastian :D
